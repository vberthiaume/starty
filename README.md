# Starty — JUCE plugin starter

A starting point for a new JUCE audio-plugin project. Adds a CI sanitizer matrix (ASan, UBSan, TSan, RTSan), clang-tidy as a PR-comment bot, RTSan-aware attribute macros, and a clang-format pre-commit hook to the [Pamplejuce](https://github.com/sudara/pamplejuce) template. The placeholder plugin name is `Starty` — see [Rename](#rename-starty--your-plugin-name) for what to change when forking.

## Rename `Starty` → your plugin name

Pick names. Example values for a hypothetical "Spangle" plugin by "Acme Audio":

| Identifier | What it is | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `PROJECT_NAME` | Internal CMake target name (no spaces) | `Spangle` |
| `PRODUCT_NAME` | Display name shown in DAWs (spaces OK) | `Spangle` |
| `COMPANY_NAME` | Manufacturer | `Acme Audio` |
| `BUNDLE_ID` | macOS reverse-DNS bundle id | `com.acmeaudio.spangle` |
| `PLUGIN_MANUFACTURER_CODE` | 4 chars, **first uppercase** | `Acme` |
| `PLUGIN_CODE` | 4 chars, ≥1 uppercase, unique per plugin | `Spgl` |

Then update each of these locations:

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `CMakeLists.txt` | `PROJECT_NAME`, `PRODUCT_NAME`, `COMPANY_NAME`, `BUNDLE_ID`, `PLUGIN_MANUFACTURER_CODE`, `PLUGIN_CODE`, `PRODUCT_NAME_WITHOUT_VERSION` |
| `tests/PluginBasics.cpp` | The expected name string in the `Plugin instance` test |
| `packaging/dmg.json` | `title`, `icon`, and the `dmg/Starty.*` paths |
| `packaging/resources/README` | Installer thank-you text |
| `packaging/starty.icns` | Rename file to match new product name **and** replace the image with your own. The macOS CI workflow uses this to brand the `.vst3`/`.au`/`.clap` bundles with a custom Finder icon — leave the placeholder and your plugins will look like the Starty template. Also update the `sips`/`DeRez` lines in `.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml` to point at the renamed file. |
| `packaging/icon.png` | Generic placeholder used as `ICON_BIG` for the Standalone app (referenced from `CMakeLists.txt`). Replace the image with your own; the filename can stay since it's not name-specific. |
| `.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml` | Workflow `name:` (line 1) |
| `README.md` | Build badge URL (point at your repo), `License` section copyright line, the title at the top |
| `LICENSE` / `README.md` License section | Update the copyright holder if appropriate |

Shortcut: editor-wide case-aware find-and-replace of `Starty` → `Spangle` and `starty` → `spangle`, then double-check that the `.icns` got renamed — most find/replace tools skip binary files.

## Install dependencies
### macOS
```bash
brew install cmake ninja clang-format          # Homebrew: https://brew.sh
```

### Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  cmake ninja-build clang clang-format lld \
  libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxinerama-dev libxext-dev \
  libfreetype6-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
```

### Windows
- **[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)** (add to PATH during install).
- **[Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases)** on PATH (or `choco install ninja`).

## Install the pre-commit hook

One-time, per clone. Refuses commits whose staged C/C++ files aren't clang-format clean (see `.githooks/pre-commit`):

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Build
```bash
cmake -B Builds -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
cmake --build Builds
ctest --test-dir Builds --output-on-failure
```

For a universal macOS binary, add `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"` to the configure step.

## Run RTSan locally (macOS)
CI runs RealtimeSanitizer on Linux. To check locally on macOS, install Homebrew LLVM — Apple Clang doesn't ship the RTSan runtime:
```bash
brew install llvm
```

Configure a separate build dir using brew's clang and the realtime flags:
```bash
CC=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang \
CXX=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++ \
cmake -B Builds-rtsan -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fsanitize=realtime" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsanitize=realtime" \
  -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-fsanitize=realtime"
```

Build and run:
```bash
cmake --build Builds-rtsan --target Tests
ctest --test-dir Builds-rtsan --output-on-failure --verbose -E NOT_BUILT
```

## Binary assets
JUCE can embed arbitrary binary files (images, sounds, fonts) directly into each plugin format, exposing them at runtime via the `BinaryData::` namespace. The `assets/` folder ships with a placeholder `images/pamplejuce.png` (the original Pamplejuce template banner) so the binary-data target always has at least one input — replace it with your own when you fork.

Drop new files anywhere inside `assets/`. Subdirectories are flattened, so don't reuse the same basename across folders — the symbols would collide. On the next build they're auto-bundled:

```
assets/images/logo.png   →  BinaryData::logo_png   +  BinaryData::logo_pngSize
assets/sounds/click.wav  →  BinaryData::click_wav  +  BinaryData::click_wavSize
```

Wired up by `cmake/Assets.cmake` (a recursive glob). `juce_add_binary_data()` requires at least one source file, which is why we ship the placeholder rather than leaving the folder empty.

## CI

Every push and PR triggers:
- `build_and_test` — Linux/macOS/Windows, `pluginval` validation, artifact upload
- `sanitizers` — ASan / UBSan / TSan / RTSan (clang-20 for the latter)
- `clang-tidy` — posts review comments on PRs

`nightly.yml` runs the same fan-out daily at 10:00 UTC, to catch external drift (JUCE submodule on `develop`, apt packages, GitHub runner images) between commits. Disable by commenting out the `schedule:` block in that file if you don't want the daily runs.
